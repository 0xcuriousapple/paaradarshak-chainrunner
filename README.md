## The Problem It Solves 🌈

- Several donation campaigns are initiated to raise funds for those in need. 
- The donor is not aware of the way these funds are being utilized. 
- With Pardarshak the donor can not only visualize how the total funds raised are being utilized but will also be able to know how his individual contribution is being used.
- Pardarshak redefines trust by enabling highly visible and traceable transactions, allowing donors to track all their transactions from the beginning to the end and verify where their funds were used. 
- It also prevents fraudulent intermediaries from pocketing part of the money that was meant for the recipient. 
- The system is decentralized and can be managed by the people eliminating the need of a central authority for collecting the donations.
