## The Problem It Solves 🌈

- Payers are unaware of how their money is utilized
- Fraudulent authorities indulge in corruption
- These problems restrict payers from paying proper tax or donate in a campaign as they are not sure about the legitimacy of authorities in the chain

## Solution

- **Track** : Payer can track how his individual contribution is being used.
- **Audit** : Anyone can audit how the total funds are being utilized
- **Corruptionless** : The exchange of funds between authorities is publicly available and is immutable.

## Future Aspects 🚀

- **Payment via UPI | Onboarding more people**

Currently users pay in Matic Tokens,UPI can be integrated as a mode of payment. But it was not possible to get a GSTIN number to connect with payment APIs like (Razor or Google pay) in such a short time.

- **Uploading Result Proof | Adding more Legitimacy**

Currently the last stakeholder of authority chains, just enters the result as text without giving any proof for it. We plan to add a feature where they can upload result receipt or photo through MoBit.
