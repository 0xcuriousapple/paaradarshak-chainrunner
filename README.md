## Problem üåà

- Payers are unaware of how their money is utilized
- Fraudulent authorities indulge in corruption
- These problems restrict payers from paying proper tax or donate in a campaign as they are not sure about the legitimacy of authorities in the chain

## Solution ‚úîÔ∏è

- **Track** : Payer can track how his individual contribution is being used.
- **Audit** : Anyone can audit how the total funds are being utilized
- **Corruptionless** : The exchange of funds between authorities is publicly available and is immutable.

## Working Demo üî• 

[![Paardarshak Demo](https://j.gifs.com/QnlRQ0.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uxsD9Enb9Q)

## Technologies Used ‚ö°Ô∏è
-  Front End Frameworks: **HTML, CSS, React, Javascript**
-  Compiling and Deploying Smart Contracts:  **Truffle**
-  Blockchain used:  **Matic**
-  Interacting with Smart Contracts:  **Web3 JS**

## Instructions üìù 

### Installation

Get started quickly by cloning this repository. Install the dependencies
```sh
$ cd client && npm install
```

### Testing on Local Truffle Blockchain

- Create .secret file with your Mnemonic
* In root directoy create .secret file
* Open metamask and Go to Setting
* Go to Security and policy
* Click Reveal seed words and Enter password
* Copy the mnemonic (never push it to public repo)
* Paste it in .secret file


- Truffle Development Console
```sh
$ truffle develop
```
This will open truffle developer console and you will get 10 Account Addresses, import some of them in metamask by import account option.

- Truffle Compile
```sh
$ truffle compile
```
- Truffle Migration Local Network
```sh
$ truffle migrate
```
- Truffle Migration Matic Network
```sh
$ truffle migrate --network matic
```
### Starting the Server
```sh
$ cd client && npm start
```

## Future Aspects üöÄ

- **Payment via UPI | Onboarding more people**

Currently users pay in Matic Tokens,UPI can be integrated as a mode of payment. But it was not possible to get a GSTIN number to connect with payment APIs like (Razor or Google pay) in such a short time.

- **Uploading Result Proof | Adding more Legitimacy**

Currently the last stakeholder of authority chains, just enters the result as text without giving any proof for it. We plan to add a feature where they can upload result receipt or photo through MoBit.
