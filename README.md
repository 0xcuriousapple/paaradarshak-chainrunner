## Technologies Used ⚡️
-  Front End Frameworks: **HTML, CSS, React, Javascript**
-  Compiling and Deploying Smart Contracts: **Truffle**
-  Blockchain used: **Matic**
-  Interacting with Smart Contracts: **Web3 JS**

## Libraries Used ⚡️

- **Truffle** 

  Truffle is framework used for compiling, deploying and interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We chose Truffle beacuse we were familiar with it as we had used it in a previous hackathon.

- **React**

  React also known as React.js or ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook. We used React so that we can quickly build a PWA version of our projecct.

## The Problem It Solves 🌈

- Several donation campaigns are initiated to raise funds for those in need. 
- The donor is not aware of the way these funds are being utilized. 
- With Pardarshak the donor can not only visualize how the total funds raised are being utilized but will also be able to know how his individual contribution is being used.
- Pardarshak redefines trust by enabling highly visible and traceable transactions, allowing donors to track all their transactions from the beginning to the end and verify where their funds were used. 
- It also prevents fraudulent intermediaries from pocketing part of the money that was meant for the recipient. 
- The system is decentralized and can be managed by the people eliminating the need of a central authority for collecting the donations.
