## The Problem It Solves 🌈

- Payers are unaware of how their money is utilized
- Fraudulent authorities indulge in corruption
- These problems restrict payers from paying proper tax or donate in a campaign as they are not sure about the legitimacy of authorities in the chain

## Solution

- **Track** : Payer can track how his individual contribution is being used.
- **Audit** : Anyone can audit how the total funds are being utilized
- **Corruptionless** : The exchange of funds between authorities is publicly available and is immutable.

## Technologies Used ⚡️
-  Front End Frameworks: **HTML, CSS, React, Javascript**
-  Compiling and Deploying Smart Contracts:  **Truffle**
-  Blockchain used:  **Matic**
-  Interacting with Smart Contracts:  **Web3 JS**

## Instructions 📝 

### Installation

Get started quickly by cloning this repository. Install the dependencies
```sh
$ cd client && npm install
```

### Testing on Local Truffle Blockchain

- Creating .secret file for your mnemonic
1) In root directoy create .secret file
2) open metamask
3) click on circle blue one
4) settings
5) security and policy
6) reveal seed words
7) enter password
8) next
9) copy the mnemonic (never push it to public repo)
10) paste in .secret

- Truffle Development Console
```sh
$ truffle develop
```
this will open truffle developer console
you will get 10 account addresses , import some of them in metamask by import account option.

- Truffle Compile
```sh
$ truffle compile
```
- Truffle Migration
Local Network
```sh
$ truffle migrate
```
Matic Network
```sh
$ truffle migrate --network matic
```
### Starting the Server
```sh
$ cd client && npm start
```

## Future Aspects 🚀

- **Payment via UPI | Onboarding more people**

Currently users pay in Matic Tokens,UPI can be integrated as a mode of payment. But it was not possible to get a GSTIN number to connect with payment APIs like (Razor or Google pay) in such a short time.

- **Uploading Result Proof | Adding more Legitimacy**

Currently the last stakeholder of authority chains, just enters the result as text without giving any proof for it. We plan to add a feature where they can upload result receipt or photo through MoBit.
